# Exercise 6 - Freestyle

Job well done! Now you are through the basics. The next task is a bonus task and it will require you to use all the knowledge you have aquired up until now. 

:star: [Open the starting point for this assignment at codepen](https://codepen.io/marenpg/pen/VwZoywE).

As you can see the starting point is a simple HTML page. I would recommend doing the following things before starting to write the CSS:
1. Identify elements that could have similar styles and give them the same class names
2. Give the rest of the elements descriptive class names. 
3. Unique items can have the id tag or you could target the element itself if the element is unique, for example "footer"

Continue on with the layout. Use floats/flex as we have gone through, or if you want a new challenge take a look at using [grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout) for the layout. Make sure your layout is responsive. 

Next up you can start making things pretti(er):
- Give the links a proper styling, use transitions or animations when hovering
- Change font for all default html tags and make the font and font sizes work together
- Make the menu look like a menu instead of some links
- Give the header some styling
- Give the footer some styling

Good luck!
